## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
1. Approach
Waterfall: Linear and sequential. Projects are divided into distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) that must be completed in order.
Agile: Iterative and incremental. Projects are broken into small, manageable iterations (sprints) that deliver working software incrementally.

2. Flexibility
Waterfall: Rigid. Changes are difficult to accommodate once a phase is completed, making it less adaptable to evolving requirements.
Agile: Highly flexible. Embraces changes throughout the project, allowing teams to adapt to new requirements or feedback.

3. Customer Involvement
Waterfall: Limited. Customer feedback is typically gathered only at the beginning (requirements) and end (delivery) of the project.
Agile: Continuous. Customers are actively involved throughout the project, providing feedback at the end of each iteration.

4. Project Timeline
Waterfall: Long delivery cycles. The final product is delivered only at the end of the project.
Agile: Short delivery cycles. Working software is delivered incrementally, often in 2-4 week sprints.

5. Risk Management
Waterfall: Higher risk. Issues may only surface late in the project, making them costly and time-consuming to fix.
Agile: Lower risk. Issues are identified and addressed early in each iteration, reducing overall project risk.

6. Documentation
Waterfall: Heavy emphasis on documentation. Each phase requires detailed documentation before moving to the next.
Agile: Lightweight documentation. Focuses on working software over comprehensive documentation, though some documentation is still necessary.

7. Team Structure
Waterfall: Hierarchical. Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, with limited collaboration between phases.
Agile: Collaborative. Cross-functional teams work together closely, with shared responsibility for deliverables.

8. Suitability
Waterfall: Best for projects with well-defined, stable requirements and minimal expected changes (e.g., construction, manufacturing).
Agile: Ideal for projects with evolving requirements, high uncertainty, or a need for frequent deliverables (e.g., software development, startups).

9. Pros and Cons
Waterfall Pros:
Clear structure and milestones.
Easy to manage and understand.
